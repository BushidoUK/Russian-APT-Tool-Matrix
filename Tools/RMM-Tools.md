## Remote Monitoring & Management (RMM) Tools

> [!TIP]
> - An RMM (Remote Monitoring and Management) tool is a type of software used by IT professionals and managed service providers (MSPs) to remotely monitor, manage, and maintain IT systems, networks, and devices.
> - These tools are designed to improve the efficiency of IT operations by enabling technicians to handle tasks from a centralized location without the need for physical access to client devices. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By operating through legitimate RMM channels, attackers can evade detection by blending in with regular IT activities and potentially bypass security measures due to the elevated privileges these tools provide.
