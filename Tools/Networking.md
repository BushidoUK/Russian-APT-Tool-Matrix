## Networking Tools

> [!TIP]
> - There are a number of network tunneling tools available online for managing and interacting with systems across different environments.
> - They allow users to securely connect to remote servers or services through encrypted channels that can bypass network restrictions and firewalls.
> - These tools may also expose local development servers to the internet for testing and sharing.
> - They are widely used for tasks like remote administration and development workflows, offering flexibility in network management.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Cybercriminals can utilize network tunneling tools to create encrypted tunnels, evade detection, and access restricted networks.
> - These tools essentially facilitate command and control for an adversary, helping them to maintain a foothold and orchestrate further malicious activities.
